## Barco EventMaster
This module uses the official EventMaster JSON API. Unfortunately the JSON API is not available in the simulator, so you need to use the real deal to get this working (or the virtual box simulator). If the status is OK, it ONLY means that the IP configured answers on icmp ping.
